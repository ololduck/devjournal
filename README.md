# ̀ devjournal`

*devjournal* is a online plateform for the independent developper. It is mainly
a developpment log, but with some spice.

## Features

A list of (intended) features is worth a thousand words:

* A wiki for each project, with its own automatic subpages, such as:

    * Statistics: how much time has been spent on this project, on what
      (development, design...), which month has been more productive, and so on
    * Release history: where you can see when you released stuff
    * Commit history?
* Statistics
* Global release history
* And, of course, free creation of pages, on whatever subject you would like to
  write about.

## Idea (*pitch-my-app*)

The original idea of this project was to provide a *"framework"*, or a set of
guidelines, to write free software by passion, and keep the motivation to
maintain the written software.

The key concepts were **openness**, **transparency**, **feedback**, **documentation**

* **Openness**: I wanted to be able to show things, without beeing ashamed of
  it.
* **Transparency**: Most of the things public. The code, the documentation, the
  time spent, all that is public.
* **feedback**: I wanted to have metrics,  information about how my time was
  spent. That motivates me immensly.
* **Documentation**: I want it to be a place of documentation, a bit like
  pocoo.org is where every documentation created by the pocoo team.

With these concepts in mind, I wanted a software that could showcase all this,
and the projects behind.

So here's my attempt.

## Keypoints

* Python
* Angular
* Wiki-like
* Custom behaviours for some pages
* showcase of your work.
* everything open (information wants to be free!)
